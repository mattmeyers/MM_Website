            Hey, I'm Matt and this is my personal website.  I graduated December 2017 from the University of Delaware where I studied applied mathematics, computer science, and physics.  I was involved in two summer research projects based around data analysis and numerical methods using MATLAB.  Lately I've been working at MCG Strategic where I have been learning about web development.  Check my projects page for more info.  Also, feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/mattmeyers" class="text-link">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/mattmeyers" class="text-link">GitLab</a> for some examples of code that I have written.
